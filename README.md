## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```
```bash
cd your-repo-name
```
Install required gems: Run the following command to install all the Ruby dependencies.
```bash
bundle install
```
Install JavaScript dependencies: Ensure that you have Node.js and Yarn installed. Then, run:
```bash
yarn install
```
Set up MongoDB: Make sure you have MongoDB installed and running on your system. Configure the MongoDB connection in config/mongoid.yml.

Set up the database: Since we are using MongoDB with Mongoid, the database is automatically created on first interaction, but you can create it with:
```bash
rails db:seed
```
Precompile assets (optional for production):
```bash
rails assets:precompile
```
Start the Rails server: Run the following command to start the development server:
```bash
rails server
```
You can access the application at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage

Adding Courses
Navigate to /courses/new.
Fill in the course details including title, description, and thumbnail image.
Add multiple materials, each with a title, description, and rich content using CKEditor.
Save the course, and it will be stored in MongoDB.
Managing Materials
You can dynamically add and remove materials using the "Add Material" button. The materials can be edited inline within the course form.
Testing
This project uses RSpec for testing. To run the tests, use the following command:
```bash
bundle exec rspec
```
You can also write feature and integration tests to ensure the application's behavior is correct.
